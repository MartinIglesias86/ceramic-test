# App to test the connection to Ceramic, and basic profile creation.

In this project I'm going to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to create the app, alongside the ethers.js, web3Modal and Ceramic libraries. Everything is gonna be running in the Rinkeby testnet.
